# MantaNet
Mantaray NetHunter flashing script.

Still a work in progress.

I have had to reflash the nexus10 mantaray stock image using adb, push superSU to gain root, and then push nethunter overlay image too many times.

Figured I should make something to do it for me for the next time I end up corrupting the software. 

Then the OSCP Team put out the nethunter installer binary, so the script seemed a bit futile.

I'll be working to get it operational and fully functional regardless.

In the meantime, here is the code.
